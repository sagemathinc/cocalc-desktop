# Todo list for cocalc-desktop

## A minimal _**first**_ usable release

- [x] cut/paste/copy are missing!
- [x] Icon
- [x] Change Help menu to be about CoCalc (?)
- [x] Better initial app size
- [x]  "About cocalc" menu item pop-up dialog shouldn't be about Electron
- [x] Make it so quitting the application works on macOS.
- [ ] how to sign application? 
- [ ] make binaries for OS X and Windows
- [ ] post on Github? 

## After that

- [ ] typescript
